    <h3> New Home Office Phase 1 - 1st August 2022 </h3>
    With baby number three on the way and due in October I'll be losing my home
    office (the spare bedroom). I spent Friday emptying our garage so that I
    could paint the floor ready to start my new office build. Luckily, my hopes for a dry day were realised. The
    paint will stop concrete dust kicking up every time I  brush out leaves that make it under the door. Plus it looks better.

    The first coat went on well and dried quickly. The second coat was similar
    but I had to start putting everything back before it had "set hard". The
    end result was fine, albeit with some marks. With half of it covered by the new office floor and
    the other half likely taking damage as a working garage, I'm not worrying about
    it.

    The next phase is getting an internal wall up to divide the new office from
    what will be the reduced garage. I'll be paying someone to do that for
    me.
