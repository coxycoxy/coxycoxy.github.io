    <h3> New Home Office Phase 1 - 1st August 2022 </h3>
    <b>Re-written on 3rd August 2022</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    I spent Friday emptying our garage so I could paint the floor. The main reason is to stop the concrete dust kicking
    up when I brush out the leaves. We will also be taking half the space for my new home office. With our third baby on
    the way and due in October the current office will become a bedroom.
    <br>
    <br>
    The job itself went well. With the contents of the garage outside I was fortunate to avoid any rain and got a couple
    of coats on before putting everything back. The next bit will be done by a professional, hopefully in the next two
    to three weeks.
