    <h3> New Home Office Phase 1 - 4th August 2022 </h3>
    I finally got around to painting our garage floor on Friday ready for the work to make half of it my new home
    office. It will be nice to have a dedicated space.

    I also had to clear up a large fallen branch from our plumb tree. The amount of fruit growing seems to have been too
    heavy and the branch sheared off at the trunk.
