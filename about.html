    Hello and thanks for visiting my small part of the internet. This page tells you a little about me.
    <H3>Personal</H3>
    I’m married with two daughters and we live in the North West of England. I’m a techie and have been
    interested in Linux system admin and open source since the early 00’s. I got involved in public cloud early where I
    started automating with tools like Puppet and CloudFormation. When I’m not with my family or playing with tech I
    enjoy health and fitness.
    <H3>Work</H3>
    I work at <a href="https://www.cts.co">CTS</a> as the Head of GCP. We’re the largest dedicated Google Cloud partner
    in Europe. We help organisations work smarter by adopting modern technologies & ways of working. That's anything
    from containerising & modernising applications to building large scale Data & Anlaytics Platforms.
    <H3>This Site</H3>
    I use hand crafted HTML. I got fed up of the dependency management for static generators like Jekyll. Yes, Docker
    and other tools exist but it’s all extra effort in the way of writing content which I want to do more of. All I need
    is a text editor and copy & paste. It’s simple and it works. Plus it’s very lean; no JavaScript and a tiny amount of
    CSS. <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> looks simple and I will probably give it a try soon.
