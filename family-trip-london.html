    <h3> Family Trip to London - 16th August 2022 </h3>
    We're just back from a family trip to London, we had a great time. With the
    exception of this afternoon the sun was shining as it has been across the
    UK for the past week or so. The hotel air con was a nice bonus after a warm
    day in the sun and had great views of the Tower of London and Tower Bridge.
    Both were a five minute walk from our hotel.
    <br>
    <br>
    We spent two hours on a Peppa Pig bus tour on Monday. The girls enjoyed it
    plus the sandwiches and cakes were good. It gave us nice views of The
    Shard, Big Ben, St. Paul's and a few other must see attractions. Tuesday
    morning we headed over to the West End and watched Room on the Broom. It's
    a book we have read many times with both girls and we all enjoyed the show.
    <br>

    As for the London Underground, it's an amazing piece of engineering and makes
    the city so much more accessible. Unless you have a pram and several bags to
    deal with which means carrying them up and down a lot of stairs. We got lucky
    with a few stations being accessible. And we got where we needed to go.
    <br>
    <br>
    This evening we have two very tired girls and two very tired parents. It will be an early night all around.
